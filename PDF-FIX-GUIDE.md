# PDF File Fix Guide

## Issue Fixed: PDFs Not Opening in Adobe Acrobat

We identified and fixed the issue with PDF files not opening in Adobe Acrobat. The problem was that the files were being saved with a `.pdf` extension but contained HTML content instead of actual PDF data.

## What We Fixed

1. **PDF Generation**: Updated the application to use PDFKit to generate proper PDF files that are compatible with Adobe Acrobat and other PDF readers.

2. **Existing Files**: Created a conversion utility to fix any existing "fake PDF" files by converting them to proper PDF format while preserving the content.

3. **File Download Process**: Enhanced the download process to ensure proper Content-Type headers and file format validation.

## How to Test the Fix

1. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000

4. Enter "test_district" as the District Name

5. Click "Show Download Progress" at the bottom of the page

6. Try downloading the individual PDF files or the ZIP file

7. Open the downloaded files with Adobe Acrobat - they should now open correctly

## Additional Utilities Created

1. **verify-pdf-files.js**: Use this script to check if all PDF files in the backend/pdf_output folder are valid PDFs.
   ```
   node verify-pdf-files.js
   ```

2. **convert-invalid-pdfs.js**: Use this script to convert any invalid PDF files to valid ones.
   ```
   node convert-invalid-pdfs.js
   ```

## Technical Changes Made

1. Updated the scraping process in `server.js` to use PDFKit for generating proper PDFs
2. Added validation in the frontend to check Content-Type headers of downloaded files
3. Fixed the download endpoint to set proper Content-Length and Content-Type headers
4. Created test PDFs using PDFKit for testing and validation

The application now properly generates and serves PDF files that will open correctly in Adobe Acrobat and other PDF readers.
